          Many people come and visit us also to look for an animal to care 
          for. We hold adoption days on the 1st and 3rd Sunday of the month.</p>

                    work. But I'm paid to do my hobby, so I never know what to
                    answer. Some people wonder what they would do if they didn't have to
                    work... but I know what I would do, because I was unemployed for a
                    year, and I filled that time doing exactly what I do now. But I'm
                    paid to do my hobby, so I never know what to answer. </q>

                    <p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (see the original proposal). He coined the term "World Wide Web," 
                    wrote the first World Wide Web server, "httpd," and the first client program (a browser and editor), "WorldWideWeb," in 
                    October 1990. He wrote the first version of the "HyperText Markup Language" (HTML), the document formatting language with 
                    the capability for hypertext links that became the primary publishing format for the Web. His initial specifications for 
                    URIs, HTTP, and HTML were refined and discussed in larger circles as Web technology spread.</p>
